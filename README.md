Makes it so that the Mages drop at least one of each of their loot.

It seems to be work for the Nameless and other hunts as well in my limited testing.

# Installation

- Copy everything from the `dist` directory to the game directory and replace all after backing up.

# Merge with other mods

- Move the `src/main.py` file to where your custom `monsters.json` file lies.
- Open a terminal in the same directory and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
- Rename the output file and repack as usual.
